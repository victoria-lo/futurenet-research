## **SECTION 1 — Product Concept & Target Age Group**

### **1.1 What is NTT Docomo Kids Keitai?**

NTT Docomo’s **Kids Keitai** is a child-specific mobile handset + service plan designed for **children who are too young for smartphones but old enough to move independently outside the home**.
It is positioned as a **safety and communication device**, not a first smartphone.

The product concept is built around:

* **Basic calling**
* **Simple messaging**
* **GPS location**
* **Emergency buzzer**
* **No web browser, no apps, no social media**
* **Communication restricted to registered/whitelisted contacts**

Docomo emphasises that the Kids Keitai is **designed as safe and fun kids' mobile phones**, with functions and devices designed and designed with the assumption that they will be used by children, to protect children from crime and accidents. This includes the hardware design, software restrictions, parental controls, and the way the phone fits into a child’s daily routine.

### **1.2 Target Age Group (Japan)**

Although Docomo’s marketing sometimes mentions “older children or older kindergarteners”, the **practical target age** seems to be **lower to mid elementary (6–10)**
* Many children **begin commuting alone at first grade** (age 6).
* Parents want a simple way to **reach their child**, and to **know the child’s location** while walking to/from school or after-school classes.
* By upper elementary (around 10–12), kids' smartphone ownership is more common, and the transition from “family phone / kids keitai / no phone” to personal smartphone accelerates. 
* Purchases for kindergarteners are less common; the main purchase spike is **school entry (age 6-7)**.

### **1.3 Product Line-up**

Docomo currently offers two devices:

#### **1. Kids Keitai KY-41C** (handset model)

* A small, rugged, child-friendly mobile phone with:

  * camera
  * +Message
  * pre-registered/whitelisted contacts
  * location features
  * large emergency buzzer strap
  * no browser/no apps
* Designed so young children can take it to school or activities.

#### **2. Kids Keitai Compact SK-41D** (wearable/compact model)

* A **smaller, lightweight device** designed to be worn on the wrist or clipped onto a school bag
* Created from parent feedback that children often **forget to carry** the main handset or don’t hear incoming calls in a bag.
* Same software philosophy (no browser, no apps, safety + communication).

Both share the same “安心・安全” (safety and peace of mind) concept, differing mainly in **form factor**.

## **SECTION 2 — Safety Features & Safety Model**

NTT Docomo’s Kids Keitai groups features into four practical safety domains:

1. Restricted communication
2. Location awareness
3. Emergency response features
4. Physical/operational safety by design

### **2.1 Communication Safety (Whitelisted Contacts Only)**

#### **Whitelisted calling & messaging**
* Kids Keitai devices **only allow communication with pre-registered contacts** in the address book. 
* Children **cannot call or message unknown numbers**, and unknown numbers cannot freely reach the child.  

#### **+Message with restrictions**
* Supports **text**, **voice messages**, **stamps**, and **photos/videos** (model-dependent) and still limited to pre-registered contacts.

#### **No browser, no app store**
* Kids Keitai devices have **no internet browser** and **no ability to install third-party apps**. 
* The omission is deliberate. This limitation prevents children from running into unnecessary trouble on the internet.

### **2.2 Location Safety & Watch-Over Model**

#### **GPS-based location checking**
* Parents can check the child’s location through Docomo’s watch-over services (e.g., “imadoco search” or integrated guardian app).

#### **“Home Arrival” Wi-Fi detection**
* Kids Keitai KY-41C can detect a **registered home Wi-Fi network** and automatically send a message to parents confirming the child has arrived home.

#### **Watch-over zone / safe-area alerts**
* If the child **leaves a configured safe zone**, the guardian app receives a warning. This is designed for after-school commuting routes.

#### **Battery / power-off alerts with location update**
* If the child’s device battery drops below a threshold, or if the device is turned off (when simple power-off mode is enabled), the watch-over service automatically attempts a location search and sends a notification to parents/guardians.

### **2.3 Emergency Response Features**

#### **Large physical emergency buzzer**
The Kids Keitai includes a high-volume emergency buzzer, activated by pulling the dedicated strap.
Docomo states the buzzer emits approximately 100 dB, designed to attract the attention of nearby adults.

When the buzzer is activated, the device also:
* Automatically sends the child’s location to registered caregivers through the watch-over service.
* (Model-dependent) May flash an LED light to attract attention.
* (Model-dependent) May initiate a call to a pre-registered emergency contact, depending on device settings and model generation.

#### **Emergency calls (110 / 119)**
Kids Keitai devices allow calls to Japan’s emergency numbers 110 (police) and 119 (fire/ambulance) even when other communication features are restricted.

### **2.4 Physical Safety & Child-Centric Hardware Decisions**

#### **Water / dust resistance and durability**
* Kids Keitai KY-41C is rated IPX5/IPX8 (waterproof) and IP6X (dust-resistant), making it more resistant than a typical smartphone to water and dust exposure. 

#### **Hygiene-friendly design**
* The device is designed for children’s use: the manufacturer and product designers note that its rugged and rounded body can be cleaned with mild hand-soap if it gets dirty. 

#### **Child-friendly ergonomic design**
* The form factor and soft, rounded design aim to make the phone easier and safer for children to hold and handle. 

### **2.5 Remote Management by Parents**

On supported models (KY-41C), parents can perform remote operations through the guardian app:

* **Trigger auto-answer** if the child is not responding
* **Disable silent mode** remotely
* **Force the phone to ring at maximum volume**

Docomo frames this as helping parents reach the child even if:

* the phone is inside the school bag,
* the child forgot to switch sound on,
* or the child is nervous and not answering.

### **2.6 Safety Philosophy (Docomo’s Position)**

Docomo repeatedly positions Kids Keitai as:

**“A device made specifically for children — not a mini smartphone.”**

They emphasise safety over features:

* No internet → avoids online harm.
* Restricted contacts → prevents strangers contacting child.
* Emergency buzzer → immediate real-world intervention.
* GPS → designed to give parents peace of mind while enabling children’s independent activity.

## **SECTION 3 — Device Hardware & UI Approach**

### **3.1 Industrial Design Philosophy**

* Kids Keitai is designed from the ground up for **young children**, not as a scaled-down adult phone. 
* The hardware and UX reflect child-specific needs such as grip comfort, visibility, safety, carryability, and independence.

Key principles include:
* **Rounded, compact form factor**: A small, soft-edged body that fits easily into small hands and school bags.
* **Colour selection based on children’s preferences**: Colours such as lavender, yellow, and blue are selected to appeal to lower-primary children. These colours also reflect popular trends in Japanese children’s accessories.
* **Wrist-wearable model (SK-41D)**: This model can be worn on the wrist or clipped onto a school bag. It was designed because children often forget to bring the main handset or do not notice calls when the phone is inside the bag.

### **3.2 Physical Durability & Hygiene**

* **Military-grade toughness**: The device offers enhanced durability with shock resistance, waterproofing (IPX5/IPX8), and dust resistance (IP6X), suitable for daily use by young children.
* **Washable with foaming hand soap**: The body is designed to be washed with hand soap, supporting hygiene needs in schools and after-school environments.

### **3.3 UI & Interaction Approach**

* **Simple home screen**: The UI is reduced to essential functions such as **Call**, **+Message**, **Location**, and **Settings**, with a large central clock.
* **Large touch targets**: Buttons and icons are sized for smaller hands and developing motor skills.
* **No app store / no browser**: The OS has no app drawer, no app installation option, and no browser. This removes unnecessary complexity and prevents internet-related risks.
* **Camera & messaging included for communication value**: The camera and +Message features serve practical communication purposes, such as sending reassurance photos to parents.
* **Multi-modal cues**: Important notifications use sound, vibration and simple visual cues to ensure a child notices calls or messages.

### **3.4 Accessories & Customisation**

Kids Keitai works with child-friendly accessories from brands popular among Japanese primary schoolers (e.g., petit main, Sumikko Gurashi, Kirby, Sanrio (varies by generation)).
These promote attachment and increase the likelihood that children consistently carry the device.

### **3.5 Hardware Limitations (Deliberate)**

Docomo emphasises that the constrained hardware and limited features are deliberate design choices to minimise distractions, extend battery life, and prioritise safety and reliability for children.

## **SECTION 5 — Regulations & Telco Partnerships**

### **5.1 Regulatory Environment in Japan (Child Safety & Mobile Use)**

Kids Keitai is shaped heavily by Japan’s regulatory and cultural environment around children and mobile devices. Three major regulatory layers influence its design:

#### **A. Youth Internet Safety Law**

Japan’s **Act on Development of an Environment that Provides Safe and Secure Internet Use for Young People** requires carriers to:

* Explain filtering services to parents
* Enable filtering by default unless parents explicitly opt out
* Promote safe mobile/internet environments for minors

This law applies broadly to all carriers and directly supports the rationale for Kids Keitai’s **no browser / no app store** model.

#### **B. Local Government Policies**

Some regions (e.g., Osaka Prefecture) have additional regulations requiring:

* Mandatory filtering for minors
* Parent/guardian responsibility statements if opting out

These reinforce the expectation that phones used by young children must *not* expose them to the open internet.

#### **C. Emergency Access Requirements**

Devices must continue to allow calls to emergency numbers like **110 (police)** and **119 (ambulance/fire)** even under restricted communication modes — a standard requirement for all mobile devices in Japan.

Together, these regulations create an environment in which a **locked-down, safety-first child phone** is not only accepted but expected.

### **5.2 Carrier-Level Strategy & Ecosystem Fit**

Kids Keitai is deeply integrated into Docomo’s broader telco ecosystem rather than functioning as a standalone device.

#### **A. Integration with Docomo Family Discount Ecosystem**

The product is meant to fit into Docomo’s multi-line household bundles.

This positioning aligns with typical telco strategy: low-cost secondary lines increase household retention.

#### **B. Integration with Location Services (Imadoco Search)**

Kids Keitai relies on Docomo’s long-running location service platform, **Imadoco Search**, for GPS-based child monitoring.

Distinct traits:

* The *guardian* does not need to be a Docomo mobile user
* The service is billed separately, enabling multi-guardian households
* It provides a carrier-grade, reliable location system rather than a third-party GPS app

This reinforces the idea that Kids Keitai is **network-first hardware**.

#### **C. Integration with +Message (RCS)**

Kids Keitai supports Japan’s cross-carrier RCS initiative, **+Message**, which enables:

* Text
* Photos (model-dependent)
* Voice notes
* Stickers

While +Message is interoperable among Japanese carriers, Kids Keitai restricts it to whitelisted contacts for safety.

### **5.3 Hardware OEM Partnerships (Kyocera)**

Docomo works with **Kyocera** for Kids Keitai hardware (e.g., KY-41C).
Kyocera:

* Designs devices to Docomo’s child-safety specifications
* Implements ruggedisation features (waterproofing, dustproofing, shock tolerance) appropriate for children.
* Adopts UI/UX constraints required for Kids Keitai’s locked-down environment
* Provides device servicing under Docomo warranty programs

This tight coupling of carrier requirements and OEM design is uncommon outside the Japanese carrier ecosystem.

### **5.4 Closed vs Open Ecosystem Considerations**

Kids Keitai functions within a **closed, single-carrier ecosystem**:

* SIM-locked
* Sold primarily via Docomo retail channels
* Activated only on kids-specific plans
* Guardian apps tied to Docomo services
* Location services tied to Docomo backend

This results in:

* **Reliable control** over device capabilities
* **Predictable security and parental controls**
* **No fragmentation across telcos or OEMs**

But it limits:

* Cross-carrier compatibility
* Open expansion into app ecosystems
* Multi-country portability

This closed model is typical for Japanese carrier-branded children’s hardware.

## **SECTION 6 - How This Maps to Singapore**

### **6.1 School Age Structure & Independence Norms**
Singapore’s educational age bands mirror Japan’s:

* **Kindergarten:** typically ages **5–6**
* **Primary School:** ages **7–12**

However, **independent commuting patterns differ substantially**.

In Japan, it is normalised for children to commute independently from **Grade 1**, supported by systems such as group walking, neighbourhood patrols, and strong community involvement.

In Singapore:

* A student care centre reports that **fewer than 5% of P1–P2 students** (ages 7–8) walk home alone.
* Most parents continue escorting children until roughly **9 years and older**.
* General parenting guidance cites **10–12 years old** as a typical readiness range for solo walking, depending on route complexity and maturity.

Community discussions show mixed practices: some P1–P2 students with **very short, sheltered routes** walk independently, but many parents view early independence as risky, citing **stranger-danger concerns** rather than a child’s navigational ability.

### **6.2 Parental Priorities: Digital Safety**

Unlike Japan’s mobility-focused safety culture, Singaporean parents place heavier emphasis on **digital safety management**.

A national MDDI study highlights that parents are concerned about:

* **Screen exposure**
* **Inappropriate online content**
* **Online stranger interactions**
* **Cyberbullying**

Many children exceed recommended screen-time limits, and only **37% of parents** report confidence in guiding their children’s digital habits. Over half indicate a need for additional tools or structured support.

These concerns shape a different parental priority set:

* Managing **device distraction**
* Coordinating **pick-ups** and after-school schedules
* Ensuring **cyber safety**

### **6.3 Japan vs Singapore: Regulatory & Ecosystem Differences**

#### **Japan**

* Strong cultural and regulatory emphasis on **independent commuting safety**
* Mandatory filtering frameworks under youth internet safety laws
* Telcos collaborate with **schools**, **local governments**, and **community groups**
* Child-specific phone plans (e.g., Kids Keitai Plan) supported by both regulation and market demand

#### **Singapore**

* Independent commuting generally begins later
* Regulatory focus centres on **internet safety**, **screen-time management**, and **cyberwellness**
* **GPS trackers and child smartwatches** are far more common than dedicated child mobile phones
* Local telcos do **not** offer device-specific child safety plans comparable to Kids Keitai
* Safety tools are typically **app-based**, not SIM-plan based

### **6.4 Implications for Adapting Kids Keitai Concepts to Singapore**

These differences mean that some of Docomo’s Japan-first design assumptions—particularly **commuting-based watch-over systems**—do not translate directly into Singapore’s context.

However, several elements remain highly relevant:

* **Locked-down junior SIM tiers**
* **No-browser, no-app-store child modes**
* **Network-enforced whitelists**
* **Carrier-grade location services** for pick-up logistics
* **Curated messaging channels** between parents and children

Singapore’s telco environment may benefit from a **simplified, safety-first children’s communication device**, but its value proposition must shift toward **digital-safety management and coordination**, rather than daily solo commuting.
