| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Name | Balanced Working Parent (P02) |

| School Level | University-educated professional |

| Location / Community | Singapore, with prior experience living in US and China |

## Background
First‑time mother with two young children (around 1 and 3 years old). Grew up in China, spent the last decade in the US, and recently moved to Singapore. Used to be a product manager and is now involved in a venture‑building program. Husband is a professor and often integrates their child into his workplace.

She reads widely on parenting, especially US‑style child development and rationale‑driven approaches, and consults pediatricians to balance risks and benefits. She is navigating a shift from more flexible US norms (where kids are more accepted in work/university environments) to Singapore, where it feels less socially acceptable to bring kids into professional spaces.

Her older child is sensitive and took a long time to adapt to school; younger child is more outgoing and enjoys playing with kids downstairs. Family has reduced cashflow after leaving a corporate job, so she is intentionally prioritising core life skills, sports and emotional development over early academic competition.

---

## Goals & Motivations
- Help her children “learn how to be a person” first – becoming independent, emotionally secure, and able to protect themselves.
- Maintain a healthy balance between being a present, thoughtful parent and pursuing her own career and personal ambitions.
- Use technology in a way that supports family life (e.g., bonding, singing together, shared activities) instead of creating dependence or conflict.
- Give her children space to make mistakes and learn from them, without over‑protecting or rushing in too quickly.
- Avoid intense early academic pressure while still ensuring kids are equipped for a competitive environment like Singapore.

---

## Challenges / Pain Points
- Social norms in Singapore feel less accepting of integrating children into professional and adult spaces compared to the US.
- Constantly juggling high standards as both a professional and a mum: early mornings, preparing kids, managing sickness, and long‑term career ambitions.
- Difficulty finding truly age‑appropriate, quality digital content; grandparents sometimes expose kids to “stupid” or low‑quality online material.
- Managing her own and her husband’s different energy levels; evenings can be tiring, and it’s hard to stay consistently intentional.
- Tension between wanting to keep kids safe (from internet risks and the wider world) and recognising she cannot control everything.
- Emotional challenge of stepping back and letting kids learn from their own mistakes instead of always rushing in to protect them.

## Needs from FutureNet
| Need | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Bounded, guilt‑free screen time tools | Allows parents to get short periods of “alone time” or to rest while feeling their children are engaged safely and appropriately. |
| High‑quality, age‑appropriate content curation | Reduces the burden of filtering content herself and prevents kids (and grandparents) from defaulting to low‑quality or random videos. |
| Features that support sensitive children in school contexts | Helps kids who take longer to adapt to school or potty training to communicate needs and feel safe, without relying on full smartphones. |
| Options that emphasise family co‑use and bonding | Encourages shared activities (e.g., singing together, co‑watching) instead of isolated, addictive screen time. |
| Clear, trustworthy safety and privacy controls | Builds confidence that location or communication tools are not adding unnecessary risk, given her awareness of internet and real‑world dangers. |

## Behaviors & Digital Habits
| Category | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Time spent on devices | Kids allowed roughly 30–60 minutes of YouTube/TV, especially when sick; more flexible on weekends when watching together as a family. |
| Favorite activities | Toddler shows, YouTube videos, singing along with family; also enjoys offline activities like basketball, soccer, and swimming. |
| Communication behavior | For crises/emergencies, expects teachers or caregivers to call; does not expect young child to use a device to initiate communication. Encourages child to clearly communicate needs (e.g., potty training) to adults around them. |
| Attention span | Young children, so short attention spans; can focus on engaging shows or group singing for limited periods, but still need movement and play. |

## Emotional Considerations
She is thoughtful and reflective about tech use: sees both benefits and risks. She feels reassured when tools are clearly age‑appropriate, have strong parental controls (e.g., Parenting Mode), and support her broader parenting philosophy (autonomy, balance, emotional safety).

She may feel overwhelmed by tools that are opaque, overly complex, or that seem to push always‑on engagement or academic pressure. She wants to feel graceful with herself as a parent, not judged or forced into extremes (no tech vs. too much tech). Tools that acknowledge parents’ need for rest and personal time, without guilt, will resonate strongly.
