## Background
Retired software engineer / entrepreneur who intentionally left work early to be the primary caregiver for his 1-year-old child while his spouse continues working. He is well-read and highly researched on parenting, child development, and the effects of screen time and social media. 

He is deeply skeptical of traditional school environments both in terms of learning quality and their ability to sufficiently restrict and guide children's use of digital devices. He is seriously considering homeschooling when his child reaches schooling age.

He is very mindful of his own digital habits: minimising phone use in front of his child, using grayscale modes, and investing in low-stimulation devices (e.g. Daylight Computer). He prioritises outdoor play, playgrounds, and socialising with other children, and only uses devices purposefully (e.g. to show educational content or answer the child's questions).

## Goals & Motivations
- Raise a child who is curious, loves learning, and is not dependent on high-stimulation digital content
- Create a safe and enriching learning environment that avoids the worst harms of social media and addictive apps
- Use AI and mastery-based learning approaches (e.g. Bloom's 2 Sigma ideas) to accelerate his child's education, especially if homeschooling
- Maintain strong social interaction and play opportunities for his child even if they do not attend mainstream school
- Model healthy digital habits himself so the child learns balanced technology use from example

---

## Challenges / Pain Points
- Limited trust in mainstream schools to both maximise learning and effectively restrict harmful device and social media exposure
- Concern that, even if he restricts devices at home, his child will still be exposed to peers' phones and content at school and feel peer pressure
- Worry that Singapore's homeschooling community is small, making it harder to find regular playmates and peer groups for his child
- Friction in trying to configure current devices (e.g. iPhone) for low-stimulation use while still keeping essential features (like the camera) convenient
- Overload of information: lots of research and content about screen time and dopamine effects, but not always clear, actionable, trustworthy guidance tailored to parents like him

## Needs from FutureNet
| Need | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| Access to high-quality, research-backed guidance on healthy screen use and digital habits for young children | He already reads and shares research on dopamine, screens, and children's brains; he wants credible, synthesised guidance to inform his parenting decisions. |
| Strong, values-aligned community (e.g. homeschooling / low-tech parenting) in Singapore | He worries his child may lack peers and social interaction if they do not follow mainstream schooling paths; community reduces isolation and reinforces his parenting choices. |
| Tools or frameworks to structure AI-augmented, mastery-based learning for homeschooling | He believes in Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem and his ability to use AI, but needs concrete ways to translate that into daily learning activities for his child. |
| Low-stimulation, child-friendly digital experiences and media recommendations | He wants to avoid fast-cut, high-dopamine content, preferring dialogueless or calm media for rare screen moments (e.g. sick days). |
| Better device-level controls to keep his own and future child devices in "low-stimulation" modes by default | He currently hacks this with grayscale and specialised devices; simpler, more robust controls would make it easier to live his values day to day. |
