## Background
This persona represents a young working parent raising a preschool-aged child. The child has experienced multiple education/care contexts (infant care, preschool, a temporary homeschooling period overseas, then returning to preschool in Singapore). The parent’s style is reflective and skills-based: prioritizing the child’s self-regulation, emotional literacy, and independence rather than enforcing strict rules.

The parent does not view digital technology as inherently harmful. They see it as part of daily life that children must learn to navigate early, with guidance and boundaries that are negotiated and internalized. The caregivers generally co-parent with active communication and step in for each other when one person is overwhelmed.

---

## Goals & Motivations
- Help the child develop early self-regulation skills so they can handle more digital exposure later without becoming dependent.
- Use screens as a practical tool in real life contexts (e.g., long commutes, waiting for food) without escalating into constant consumption.
- Encourage creativity and communication: make digital experiences active (drawing, creating videos) rather than passive scrolling.
- Maintain a calm, emotionally safe home environment by coaching feelings and modeling regulation.
- Keep flexibility as the child grows, knowing peer pressure and school norms will change in primary school.

---

## Challenges / Pain Points
- Avoiding highly stimulating, addictive children’s content (regret after early exposure to Cocomelon-like design).
- Content environment complexity: even “kids” platforms can be bypassed (e.g., toggling to adult accounts/profiles).
- Managing impatience in real-world waiting moments (public transport, restaurants) without defaulting to screens every time.
- Uncertainty about future device ownership: balancing openness to devices with concerns about peer pressure as the child approaches primary school.
- Parenting stress and emotional overload: needs approaches that support co-regulation without escalating conflict.

## Needs from FutureNet
| Need | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Tools that reinforce self-regulation (not just restrictions) | Aligns with the parent’s philosophy: boundaries should be learned through practice, not only enforced externally. |
| High-quality content curation + stimulation awareness | Reduces the risk of accidentally introducing addictive/overstimulating content and supports intentional choices. |
| Transition support (gentle prompts, “finish and stop” flows) | Helps the child stop independently after a chapter/task and switch activities without conflict. |
| Parent-child co-use and creation modes | Supports bonding through shared creation (cooking/dance videos, drawing) rather than isolated consumption. |
| Guardrails for purchases/downloads + account safety | Matches her current approach: password-gated downloads and preference for paid subscriptions over algorithm feeds. |
| Future-ready guidance for device progression | Helps her plan for primary school needs and increasing peer influence (communication device vs smartphone, school norms). |

## Behaviors & Digital Habits
| Category | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Time spent on devices | Not tracked strictly via parental-control timers; boundaries are negotiated (e.g., 30 minutes + small extensions to finish). |
| Favorite activities | Child uses iPad for Duolingo Kids, digital drawing, curated shows; enjoys making videos with parent. |
| Communication behavior | Parent actively discusses boundaries and emotions; encourages child to articulate feelings and needs. |
| Attention span | Child can focus on games/shows but is supported to transition independently; screens are used as situational support during waiting. |

---

## Emotional Considerations
The parent feels reassured when digital tools support their values: reflection, autonomy, and emotional development. They are wary of content that hijacks attention or turns screen time into a fight. They prefer approaches that help the child internalize limits (“I can stop”) rather than feeling controlled (“You’re taking it away”).

They also benefit from systems that acknowledge real-life parenting constraints—commutes, meals, fatigue—without shaming parents for using screens.

## Quotes (if interview based)
> “The earlier they learn the skill of regulation, the better.”

> “I don’t want to force him. If not, he will be greedy with screen time.”

> “We didn’t have a vision. We adapted along the way.”
