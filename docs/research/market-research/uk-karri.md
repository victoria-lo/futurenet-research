# About Karri
We believe that technology should enable kids and not distract them. We want younger kids to learn how to be independent and communicate in a fun and safe way before entering the digital smart world. 

The initial idea for KARRI was already born back in 2020 when our founder Pete was increasingly frustrated by not finding a suitable child-friendly alternative to a smartphone for his then 7 year old son. 

"I was really annoyed by not being able to allow my son more freedom and independence. I knew he wanted to walk to school by himself or go meet his friends a few streets away but I was also nervous about not knowing where exactly he would be and not being able to get in touch. 

After some research and not finding a child-friendly, screen-free solution that was working reliably everywhere I came up with the idea of starting KARRI - a simple, real-time communication device without the distraction of a smart screen."

In early 2023 we found investors backing the idea financially and Carsten and Mehul, who together with Pete had developed the idea further, joined the company.

Our team has now grown to over 20 people and thanks to some dedicated customers giving feedback on our prototype we have now started shipping the first real KARRIs. 

While we still need to re-iterate and fine tune the hard- and software we are finally able to start offering young kids and parents a new alternative for communicating in a reliable and kid-friendly way.

September 2025: Official announcement of our mass-market KARRI Gen 2 in collaboration with Pentagram

## Partnership with Pentagram
London, 1st September 2025 - KARRI is delighted to announce a significant milestone in its ongoing mission to transform the way children communicate. In partnership with renowned design consultancy Pentagram and distinguished industrial designer Jon Marshall, KARRI has developed its next-generation Messenger. A pioneering voice-driven device for children aged 5–13.

KARRI believes childhood should be centred around exploration, independence, and genuine connection, free from the distractions and risks of screen-based devices. Our new, screen-free Messenger is a thoughtful alternative to smartphones for younger users, providing all the essential tools for communication while protecting children from the complexities and dangers of unrestricted internet access.

A Transformative Design Collaboration
The partnership with Jon Marshall and the Pentagram team has played a transformative role in our product journey. Pentagram’s research-led approach to industrial design has been the ideal complement to KARRI’s mission, resulting in a device that is enjoyable for children yet reassuring for parents. The team’s previous successes with child-friendly technology, such as the award-winning Yoto Player, made them the natural choice for this collaboration.

Jon Marshall’s team brought a meticulous focus to user experience, combining this with our research into family communication needs. The result is a device that not only prioritises safety and independence but also serves families in tangible ways.

# Funding Journey

## £2.1m Pre-seed, 2 October 2024
KARRI extends pre-seed to £2.1m to scale-up smart walkie talkie for kids to communicate safely with parents.

London-based KARRI has extended its pre-seed funding to £2.1m to launch a smart walkie talkie for kids, aiming to give them independence and parents peace of mind.

Screen-based devices that provide full access to the internet can be distracting, unsafe and overly complicated for young children. KARRI offers a simple solution in its data-enabled walkie talkie for four to ten year olds, which is securely integrated with a smartphone app for parents.

KARRI allows children to send messages simply by pushing a button and speaking, while parents can receive and send messages back via the KARRI app. KARRI also has GPS functionality so parents can track their kids’ location and be notified if they roam too far from home.

The extension was led by Emerge Education, with continued participation by 468 Capital and a notable group of angel investors such as Verena Pausder (an early backer of play-based learning provider Edurino and Chair of the Board at the German Startup Association), Michael Hernaus and Wolfgang Reisinger (founder and managing director of Tractive, the GPS pet tracking company) were joined by Julian Lange (experienced CFO and early backer of zolar, Huuva and Mindsurance).

The investment marks a major step forward in the company’s mission to enable a seamless way for parents and young kids to stay in touch, giving kids greater independence and parents peace of mind. KARRI will use the funding to take its 2nd generation device from its current testing phase to mass production and rollout in the UK.

Mario Barosevcic, General Partner at Emerge Education, said:

Pete Clifford, KARRI founder and Managing Director, said:
"It is our core belief that we have overprotected children in the real world while under protecting them in the virtual world. KARRI is designed to help redress this imbalance by eliminating the need to give young children a smartphone. 

Parents are increasingly concerned about their children's online safety and extensive screen time, yet they value the benefits of staying connected with them at all times in the real world. We're excited that KARRI will allow children to roam free, explore, and gain independence while ensuring their safety and giving parents peace of mind.

We aimed to make it as easy as possible for parents and children to stay in touch, so we have built a screen-free solution that is simple and reliable."

"We are delighted to Partner with KARRI. Over the last few years through our investments in kidtech and edtech products, we have seen a growing wave of parents looking for solutions that keep their young children safe and protected from harmful and excessive screen time, while still enabling them to communicate, develop their imagination and have fun.

In a *market environment* where schools around the world are increasingly banning smartphones and screens, KARRI is the perfect solution that every parent is looking for and we believe every child will be excited to use. Safe, simple, intuitive and fun."
