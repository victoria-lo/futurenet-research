## Vetted Third-Party Apps
UPDATE: The third-party app vetting process is currently paused. Development is well underway to introduce a streamlined, improved process. While we work on these enhancements, there is no concrete timeline for resumption. Submissions remain active, and we will provide updates as progress occurs. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Here’s an update on the status of third-party app requests for the Tool Drawer.

- **Review Process**: All app requests are queued for review and logged internally using the [](https://www.healthytechindex.com/Healthy-Tech-Index-10f214fba0e18029b5b8e6cc20b30930)**Healthy Tech Index**. Apps are evaluated based on their alignment with our mission to promote intentional, distraction-free technology. Only one request per app is needed to initiate the vetting process.
- **Notifications**: We currently do not have an automated system to notify users when an app is approved or denied. Each request will be reviewed, but we don’t have a set timeline for completion.
- **Customer Support**: Our customer service team is unable to provide specific timelines or escalation for individual app requests at this time.
- **Ongoing Improvements**: We’re actively working on enhancing the app vetting process to make it more efficient.
- **App Availability**: Not all requested apps are guaranteed approval or access to the Tool Drawer. We reserve the right to add or remove third-party apps at any time, and availability may vary.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to refine this process.

## Tech Stack
- Android custom ROM (derived from senior developer job posting)

The Wisephone II utilizes Samsung hardware with our WiseOS software and configurations. 

Initially, the Wisephone II was intended to be a custom hardware device. However, we quickly discovered that hardware development is—well, hard.

We at Techless are a software company.

Entering the hardware manufacturing space became challenging due to communication hardships, negotiations with intermediaries, and supply chain disruptions.

We thought, “*since we are a software company, what if we just focused on the software side of things? What if we linked arms with a hardware company that creates some of the highest quality mobile devices on the market?*”

That hardware company is Samsung.

We looked closely at the specs for the Wisephone II and found an outstanding device that matches and exceeds our specs. With the quality and power of Samsung’s hardware and security, we could spend time doing what we do best: focusing on software and people. 

*Please be aware that although we utilize Samsung’s hardware, Samsung is not involved with your account management. Therefore, their customer support will not be able to assist with any Wisephone II inquiries.*

## User Reviews
- Awesome experience. My time on a smart phone has been drastically reduced. And the Techless team responded to my inquiries about getting a certain app to work, and within a few weeks they had it done! Very grateful for what you're doing. The phone does what it's supposed to do - it keeps me off the phone! There's nothing to do on it, and that's the point. It's a tool, not a time sucker.
- I found out about Wisephone online when searching for alternatives to a smartphone which was draining far too much of my time and energy. The issue was that the necessary apps, like Maps, Banking, etc. came with the addictive, unnecessary apps like social media, internet browsing, etc.

Wisephone was the best option as far as providing what you needed while withholding what you didn't need. I gave it a shot, and after just 1 month I can say it's one of the best decisions I've made.

I won't get into absolutely everything, but I'll just say this, I literally wrote and just published my first book. And it's only been one month. I never would have had the idea, nor the focus to do this before Wisephone, but now with the addiction and distractions gone, it seems almost easy.

It's the best decision I've made in the last few years and I don't regret it one bit.
- The new Wisephone 2 is simple and efficient. Back to basics with great customer service. The toolkit option allows for some helpful apps. Great battery life, too! Thank you!
- The Wisephone has really transformed my life. I am more focused on work, life and I have less stress.
- It's a feeling of freedom that you just can't understand with a smartphone.
- I decided to use Techless to limit my use of technology and have a healthier way of using the base phone functions of calling and texting. Thank you so much, this phone has worked splendidly!
- I am so grateful I switched to Techless. The transfer of phones was seamless. Made it very easy when I started to use the Wisephone. I love the vision behind the Wisephone taking a staunch stance against the ways smart phones have not only become so engrained in our culture but has created a worldwide obsession. Phones should be functional and that is what the Wisephone is.
- I am loving my new Wisephone. I kinda' am sad to kiss my flip phone goodbye and "blend" in with society by how it looks lol But I am SO happy to have a touch screen again and to text again. I am happy with nearly everything.. The only thing that bugs me a little is that when you first unlock your phone, on the main screen, if you have a new text, I wish there was some kind of notification by the word "Messages".. It doesn't show until after I go into it. Otherwise, loving it so far. Thanks!
- It was challenging for us to get set up initially but, once we did it was worth it. My daughter is more productive and has been more rested.
