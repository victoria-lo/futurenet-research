KDDI and Okinawa Cellular will release the mamorino Watch from late March 2016 (tentative) as part of its new lineup. The mamorino Watch provides safety for children and offers support for the peace of mind of parents and guardians. It is also Japan's first children's watch capable of voice calls.

The mamorino Watch is a mobile phone in the form of a wrist watch that features water, dust, and impact resistance [2] which can be easily placed on children who have increasingly become involved in activities that separate them from their parents or guardians. The watch can also be turned into a pendant, enabling you to use the device to match different scenarios - use as a wrist watch when you want it to be constantly worn, or as a pendant when you want to attach it to a bag or backpack.

This is Japan's first [1] children's watch equipped with voice calling features, which enable parents to enjoy calls with their children and offer peace of mind by allowing them to hear their children's voice when they are in a separate location. The watch can be operated from its touch panel and also comes equipped with a voice operated assistance feature [3] that permits even small children to easily make calls and use SMS (messaging).

Furthermore, the watch is ideal as a security device for children equipped with features that can confirm a child's location and features to prevent children from becoming lost. It comes equipped with a feature to allow calls and SMS (messaging) from only preset callers, a security buzzer that sounds an alarm, transmits voices, and notifies parents and guardians of its location [4]. It also come equipped with a distance range alarm feature [5] that sounds an alarm if the device goes outside a determined distance.

In conjunction with the release of the mamorino Watch, KDDI will provide the mamorino Watch Plan with a basic charge of \998/month. By paying the basic charge, this plan allows you to comfortably use the device by providing free domestic voice calls and free domestic SMS between family members 24 hours a day, as well as free calls to other au mobile phones from 1:00 am to 9:00 pm.

KDDI will also provide the mamorino Watch Navi, a dedicated app that pairs the smartphone of a parent or guardian with the mamorino Watch. This app provides features that allow one-touch calling and SMS (messaging) with a paired mamorino Watch, remote sounding of the alarm, and various other features that allow you to more conveniently use the mamorino Watch.

The au +1 collection of official accessories has made available dedicated accessories that provide more reliable and secure use of the mamorino Watch. These include portable pouches for backpacks that can carry keys, pocket change, and cards, as well as protective films with features that reduce blue light to protect your child's eyes.

About water resistance (IPX5/IPX7), dust resistance (IP5X), and impact resistance
[Water resistance]
IPX5 equivalent: The unit will retain its functionality as a phone even if blasted with water projected at all angles through 6.3mm nozzles at a flow rate of approximately 12.5 liters/minute for more than 3 minutes from a distance of approximately 3 meters.
IPX7 equivalent: Water will not leak inside and the unit will retain its functionality even if it is gently immersed in a tank of still tap water at room temperature at a depth of 1 meter and placed on the bottom for approximately 30 minutes.
[Dust resistance]
IP5X equivalent: The unit was placed inside an apparatus containing dust particles with a diameter of 75µm or less and churned for 8 hours where after removed, the unit maintained its functionality and safety as a phone.
[Impact resistance]
A drop test was conducted in which the product was dropped in 26 different orientations onto plywood (lauan) from a height of 1.22m. This test is compliant with MIL-STD-810G Method 516.6-Shock ProcedureIV, which is established by the U.S Department of Defense. There is no guarantee against every shock. Impact resistance performance is assumed to be that for daily use. Note that the device may break if subjected to extreme impact such as throwing the device or dropping it in an excessive manner. Also, the device may become damaged from impact by dropping even if there is no abnormality in the impact resistance performance.
