## About Us
Sage Mobile was born from a desire to make smartphones safe—without sacrificing style.

Founded in 2025 in London as a subsidiary of [Techless, Inc.](https://www.techless.com/), Sage is the UK-homegrown sibling of [Wisephone](https://wisephone.com/), the minimalist phone design that sold out four times in the U.S.

Our founder, Chris Kaspar, grew up in a family with deep roots in entrepreneurship. But transitioning away from the family business inspired him to build something with even greater impact: a phone that respects your attention—not hijacks it.

When Chris and his family became foster parents, they witnessed firsthand how smartphone access disrupted relationships. It ignited a simple but powerful question: 

That spark became Sage Mobile. We designed the Sage iPhone—an iPhone free of social media, browsers, ads, and workarounds. It’s safe by design, not by surveillance.

Sage isn’t just a stripped-down iPhone or a flip phone. It’s the “smarter” smartphone, packed with all the tools and apps you need, minus the bad stuff.

### Our mission
We’re not just creating phones—we’re cultivating presence. Sage exists to:

Protect kids from digital chaos: Give children a safe, balanced introduction to technology so they can explore, learn, and connect without the risks of endless scrolling or harmful content.

Reclaim family time and meaningful connection: Shift the focus from screens to shared moments — dinners without distraction, conversations without notifications, and weekends spent together.

Restore clarity, focus, and mental well-being: Reduce the constant pull of alerts and apps so your mind has room to think, create, and simply be present.

### Why it matters
Today, parents and educators are alarmed by how much smartphones are impacting young minds. Sage offers an alternative—a phone that feels familiar, looks cool and actually puts your best interests first. .We’re proud to lead the healthy tech movement—and even prouder to help you give your kids a better start. Together, we can raise the first generation to grow up with technology that truly protects them. Welcome to the new, better path.
