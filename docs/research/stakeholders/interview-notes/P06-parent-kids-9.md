## Key Discussion Points
### Current Behaviors
- Currently doesn’t expect child to communicate directly via device; relies on whoever is with her (teacher/caregiver) to call.
- Uses iPad with Parenting Mode and curated toddler shows; allows 30 minutes of YouTube/TV a day, strictly monitor use
- Does not have any alternative activities scheduled for the child to kill time
- Lets the child find something to do when they're bored like art or games
- Allow gaming on Nintendo Switch for 1 hour a day

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- Hard to find control what's online; Kid learns quickly how to bypass iPad restrictions
- Aware of many safety threats (e.g., internet, larger societal risks) but cannot control everything.
- Struggles between wanting to quickly protect kids vs. letting them learn from their own mistakes.
- Had YouTube Kids installed on iPad but child figured out quickly how to just browse YouTube on the browser.
- Child was exposed to content on gaming and streamers playing games that's too mature for her age.
- Child lies that she has not yet had her 30 minutes a day on the iPad when mom doesn't pay attention.
- When mom knows that child lies, she tries to test if her daughter can self control but no, she's addicted to the screen until it's taken away.
- Hard to find interests her child likes to do outside screen time.
- Child learns how to use duckduckgo to browse sites outside of her allowed list.

### Desired Features / Needs
- Tools that support bounded screen time so parents can have short “alone time” without guilt or constant monitoring.
- Better curation and discovery of age‑appropriate, values‑aligned content for young children. Even browsers should easily have parental mode.
- Healthier ways to keep screen time minimal without making the child feel restricted in many ways
- Technology that facilitates family bonding activities (e.g., singing together, shared viewing) rather than just passive solo screen time.
- Filter content automatically by age (e.g if child is 9, then even browsers will not show games or streamer channels for mature audiences).
- Parent's dashboard to easily monitor child's screentime and by app category (i.e. YouTube, Chrome, Games, etc.)

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Trusts teachers/caregivers to handle emergency communication; does not expect a very young child to call directly.
- Believes strong parent‑child bond and open communication are key so kids will share if something is wrong.
- Trust that the device will protect the child from inappropriate content, even without constant monitoring.

### Opportunities / Ideas
- Position devices less as mini smartphones and more as tools that support parental self‑care and alone time.
- Design features that encourage joint media engagement (singing, co‑watching, talking about content).
- Build recommendation/filtration that adapts to age and temperament (e.g., sensitive child) and parenting philosophy.
- Have a dashboard to give parents a tool to analyze child's screen time habits.

- Explore what data she can monitor on the dashboard to feel less anxious
- Ask if shorter but more frequent sessions feel better or worse than one fixed block.
- Explore whether she sees screen discipline as a phase or a long term skill.
- Ask what success looks like if problems never fully disappear.
