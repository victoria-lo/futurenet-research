## Key Discussion Points

### Current Behaviors
- Kai (4, turning 5) has been exposed to structured childcare, homeschooling, and preschool across different environments.
- Homeschooling period was largely pen-and-paper based; screens were not necessary for core learning during that phase.
- Screen use is integrated into daily life rather than treated as a reward or taboo.
- Screen use is situational (e.g., long MRT rides, restaurants while waiting for food), not constant.
- Uses iPad mainly for:
  - Educational games (Duolingo Kids)
  - Digital drawing/art
  - Watching curated shows (Netflix, Disney+, YouTube Kids)
- Duolingo Kids was valued because it reinforced what he was learning in school; Chinese learning content was offered but he wasn’t interested.
- TV use is often more passive; iPad is also used for creative output (drawing) and shared creation.
- Screen time boundaries are negotiated rather than strictly enforced.
- Example approach: suggest a time limit (e.g., 30 minutes), then ask him if it’s enough; allow small extensions to “finish a chapter” if he can transition independently.
- Kai can independently switch off devices and transition to other activities.
- Content creation (cooking videos, dance videos) is a shared bonding activity with his mother.
- Kai is comfortable performing on camera; creation is used to build communication/storytelling skills and parent-child bonding.
- He generally doesn’t watch his own videos, but may watch “over the shoulder” while they are being reviewed.
- Parent has emotional capacity, which she attributes to her younger age as a mum, to help co-regulate emotions with child
- Parents are typically nearby even when not actively monitoring; child can navigate streaming interfaces (e.g., searching content, toggling profiles/accounts).

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- Early exposure to highly stimulating content (e.g., Cocomelon) was later regretted due to its addictive design.
- YouTube Kids still creates edge cases: child can toggle to adult accounts on Disney+ and watches Netflix via adult account.
- Managing impatience during waiting times.
- Managing “what’s next” as he grows: peer pressure/tolerance may change in primary school, so current approach may not generalize.
- Navigating uncertainty around future device ownership.

### Desired Features / Needs
- Tools that support self-regulation rather than strict restriction.
- Educational content aligned with school curricula.
- Creative digital tools rather than passive consumption.
- Support for parents to negotiate boundaries (shared goal-setting, gentle reminders, transition support) rather than enforcement-only controls.

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Trust-based parenting model.
- Password-controlled downloads.
- Paid subscriptions over algorithm-driven platforms.
- “Good enough” guardrails: child has a personal device with approved apps; cannot download without parent permission/password.

### Opportunities / Ideas
- Digital tools as creative outlets.
- Reflection and journaling as self-regulation practices.
- Parent-led emotional coaching practices can be productized: reflection prompts, end-of-day recap rituals, and tools that encourage articulation of feelings.
- Design for “co-use” moments (parent + child creation) rather than only consumption.

> “We didn’t have a vision. We adapted along the way.”

> “As long as he is able to switch off the device by himself and go about his day.”

## Follow-Ups
- Clarify what “successful self-regulation” signals look like for her (e.g., frequency of reminders needed, typical transition time, meltdown frequency).
- Explore how she would want boundaries to evolve in primary school when peer influence increases.
- Document her stance on first personal phone/device timing and whether she would prefer a communication-only device vs smartphone, given MOE device bans in secondary school.
- After the interview, she recommended the [following podcast episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3vnf2gnpC39czR4FHgvTSK?si=aRe5RoGlRFGI5sIctShCBA&t=943&ct=870) which she felt was an extension of some of the themes brought up from the episode
