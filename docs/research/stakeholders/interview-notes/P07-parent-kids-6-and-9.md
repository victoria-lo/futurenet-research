## Key Discussion Points
### Current Behaviors
- For context, her children goes to SAS, non-MOE school.
- Allows children to use iPad with curated apps for their homework, have to closely monitor their use.
- Schedules time to play sports outside often by booking badminton courts, pickleball, etc.
- Gives her 9 year old a kindle to introduce reading with a less eye straining screen rather than iPad
- Allows gaming on Nintendo Switch for ９ year old, as long as he’s being supervised by dad. Dad plays the games first before introducing to son.
- Has a rewards system where every time they played outside or they did their own chores, they get a star. Then they use stars as currency to buy things they want like toys.
- Doesn't think it's necessary to let the children have phones because she waas fine without one in her generation. She feels confident knowing they are in school. And any communication is with their teachers or other parents.
- Has a smartwatch for the child when he goes to unfamiliar places with friends to track his locaion and send him messages. They made sure he only can use the smartwatch outside home so that he doesn't get addicted using it at home. They disabled browsing featrures in the smartwatch so that it is only for communication and location tracking.
- They also disable smartwatch's communication features when they know he's at school so he doesn't get distracted by it. There was a time where they didn't and they can remotely see he was actively texting his friends from the smartwatch at school.
- Allows Netflix at home as long as they watch in the living room and asks for permission before watching PG13 movies.
- Allows PC usage for homework but he has to keep the door open for supervision. Parents still check browsing history after use.
- Trying to pitch to school to not bring phones to school because she doesn't think it's necessary.

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- Believes there is no need to have kids use iPads in class, but the school wants to integrate technology to children early.
- Aware of many safety threats (e.g., internet, larger societal risks) and were very concerned about AI usage and cyberbullying.
- Said there have been cases of other children asking chatGPT how to do their homework
- School iPads has only access to some websites to use in class only. But still worries that the filters can be easily bypassed.
- A lot of worry about how critical thinking can be developed in such a technology-dependent environment
- Because he is 9 while his younger sister is 7, they are worried he might introduce her to content online that is not appropriate yet.
- He is getting more discrete and likes to face the PC screen away from the door to get some privacy when browsing.
- Needs some incentives like using the star rewards system to get them to want to go outside to play.

### Desired Features / Needs
- School environment that promotes less use of screen time and more socializing with friends.
- Wants a way for children to be able to discern what is AI, how to use it responsibly and that they should not trust everything AI says.
- Easier way to control and monitor what they see online without having to constantly supervise.
- Technology that educates children responsible use and less dependency on it other than to make plans with friends.

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Trusts teachers/caregivers to handle emergency communication; does not expect a very young child to call directly.
- Trust that the device will protect the child from inappropriate content, even without constant monitoring.
- Allows communication with trusted adults and friends only
- Parents can slowly release more filters to get chilren to slowly learn the dangers of the internet as they get older.

### Opportunities / Ideas
- Position devices as a reliable tool for parents to teach their kids responsible internet and AI use.
- Design features that centers around growing with the child (almost like leveling up in games). As child learns, the parents will trust they can use more features.
- Build recommendation/filtration that adapts to age and temperament (e.g., sensitive child) and parenting philosophy.
- Gives parents peace of mind that the technology is only education and communication, not for more exposure to inappropriate content or creates pattern of addiction.
- Educate older siblings to use technology more responsibly so that younger siblings do not get exposed earlier than they should.
