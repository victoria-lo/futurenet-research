## Key Discussion Points

### Current Behaviors
- Both children (6 and 9 years old) have grown up entirely in Singapore despite European heritage.
- Technology use is heavily restricted and purpose-driven: devices are permitted only for homework completion.
- Screen time during homework is actively supervised; one parent monitors what the child is browsing.
- Children do not own personal devices; they use parents' phones or iPads under supervision.
- Television and streaming content (e.g., Netflix) are rare; family prefers cinema outings for movie experiences.
- Eldest daughter (9) has been given a smartwatch ([Awei brand](https://aweistore.com/products/awei-h29-kids-smart-watch-sim-card-gps-tracker)) with limited functionality: can only call/message parents and allows location tracking.
- Wife is satisfied with the smartwatch purchase as it balances communication needs with restrictions.
- Non-screen activities are actively encouraged: drawing, creative play, and hands-on exploration.
- Father gifted daughter a standalone camera (not a phone) when she expressed interest in photography, deliberately avoiding multi-function devices.
- Purchased programmable robots for Christmas that require app-based programming; screen time is carefully monitored during these activities.

### Parenting Philosophy & Values
- Acknowledges being "more controlling than other parents" and is comfortable with this stance.
- Does not view technology as inherently necessary for childhood development.
- Believes strongly in teaching children "the ability to play" without screens.
- Values moments of sustained creative engagement (e.g., daughter spending entire day drawing).
- Observes other families' screen habits in public spaces (e.g., children on iPads in restaurants) and feels this does not align with personal values.
- Concerned about children's vulnerability to online risks and prioritizes protection.

### Boundary Enforcement & Peer Pressure
- Father has established firm, consistent boundaries; daughter has learned to anticipate his responses and rarely pushes back or throws tantrums.
- When daughter requested game installations on smartwatch, father refused without hesitation.
- Does not yield to peer pressure arguments (e.g., "other kids have phones").
- Firmly rejects the idea of an "appropriate age" to give children phones; instead, believes in continuous monitoring and evaluation with spouse to determine readiness on a case-by-case basis.
- Current assessment: "now is not a good time" for personal phone ownership.

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- Navigating requests for technology as children become aware of what peers have access to.
- Balancing educational technology needs (e.g., programmable robots requiring apps) with screen time restrictions.
- Finding non-screen alternatives that fulfill children's interests and developmental needs.

### Desired Features / Needs
- Devices with highly restricted functionality (e.g., smartwatch for communication and location only).
- Tools that support intentional, purposeful use rather than open-ended access.
- Non-screen alternatives for common childhood interests (e.g., standalone camera instead of smartphone).
- Educational technology that requires supervision but supports skill development (e.g., programmable toys).

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Active parental supervision during all technology use.
- Communication-only devices with location tracking.
- Preference for single-purpose tools over multi-function devices.
- Ongoing spousal dialogue and shared decision-making about technology introduction.

### Opportunities / Ideas
- Support for parents managing peer comparison conversations with children.
- Curated lists of single-purpose educational devices (cameras, programmable toys, etc.).
- Tools that help parents evaluate readiness for device ownership based on demonstrated responsibility and maturity.
- Resources that validate intentional, low-tech parenting approaches in high-tech environments.

## Follow-Ups
- Explore what specific online risks or scenarios he is most concerned about protecting his children from.
- Clarify how homework supervision is managed logistically (e.g., does one parent always sit beside them? how long does this typically take?).
- Understand how the family navigates situations where technology use is embedded in school requirements (e.g., learning platforms, collaborative tools).
- Document how children respond when they observe peers with greater device access (e.g., at school, playdates).
- Explore what "monitoring the situation" looks like in practice: what signals or milestones would indicate readiness for increased device access?
- Investigate whether there are any technology use contexts where he feels less certain or conflicted about his current approach.
