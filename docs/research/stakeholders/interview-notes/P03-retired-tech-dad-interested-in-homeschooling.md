## Key Discussion Points
### Shared Resources
- [Data on Screen Use Effects on Children](https://open.substack.com/pub/amidwesterndoctor/p/rejuvenating-the-nervous-system-and)
- [Recommendation for Dialogueless Media for Kids: The Boy with the Kite](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rDIhk-uEImg)
- [Recommendation for Dialogueless Media for Kids: Miniscule](https://m.youtube.com/@Minuscule)
- [Video on Dopamine Highs and Lows](https://youtu.be/RhNiwwSWkiM)

### Current Behaviors
- Software engineer/entrepreneur background places him to have a higher risk appetite to try new ways of parenting and integrate tech into education
- Retired early with intention to be primary caregiver for child while spouse continues working
- Well-read and researched about best methods to raise kid
- Fully understands and believes in the negative effects of screentime and social media use
- Shares research on how dopamine affects the brain, and children's brain: 
- Strongly considering homeschooling child in the near-future due to lack of confidence over school environment in giving kids sufficient education, and in restricting kids sufficiently from the harms of digital devices
- Confident in his abilities to use AI to accelerate learning for own child through homeschooling due to belief in [Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem](https://medium.com/innerscorelearningskillstest/ai-meets-bloom-solving-the-2-sigma-problem-6e821d12f1f3), which puts forward that mastery learning results in higher performing children compared to those who learn in school contexts
- Does not give child unrestricted and unsupervised access to devices, only uses phone to show child educational materials (e.g. if child wants to know what a Jack Hammer is, he shows pictures and videos)
- Intends on keeping child off of devices for as long as plausible, but will introduce devices in a supervised and restricted fashion (i.e. teaching coding)
- Is mindful of own digital use as well, tries not to use phone infront of child and invests in things like [the Daylight Computer](https://daylightcomputer.com/) for low-stimulation devices; turns on black and white filter on own device etc.
- Believes in outdoor play, brings child outdoors alot to playgrounds, to socialize and meet children on playdates
- Does occasionally watch YouTube with child especially on sick days, but would show curated cartoons that have little dialogue so child learns to focus on visuals (see shared resources)

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- School environments don't sufficiently restrict device access for children, also unconfident that schools can maximize learning for child
- Even if child has no access to devices, can easily see what other children do in school on their phones and feel peer pressured

### Desired Features / Needs
- Looking for homeschooling resources and community, worries that due to small size of homeschooling community in Singapore, he might not be able to find other children for child to play with once they reach schooling age
- For self, wants to find an iPhone function that activates a black and white feature for majority of use whilst automatically turning on coloured mode for essential apps like the camera - in bid for low-stimulation

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Wants strong restrictions on device access within school environments so children are not easily exposed to peers' phones and social media content
- Needs clear, research-backed guidance on healthy screen habits for young children
- Prefers tools and platforms that are low-stimulation by design (e.g. e-ink / low-dopamine devices, grayscale modes)
- Needs confidence that any digital products used with his child support supervised, purposeful learning rather than passive consumption

### Opportunities / Ideas
- Build or surface a stronger homeschooling community in Singapore so children can still have regular social interaction and play
- Create tools or platforms to help parents structure AI-augmented, mastery-based homeschooling aligned with Bloom's 2 Sigma insights
- Develop an easy way to keep phones in grayscale by default while automatically enabling colour for specific apps like the camera
