## Key Discussion Points
### Current Behaviors
- Reads widely on parenting (esp. US books) and consults pediatricians to guide decisions.
- Integrates children into adult/work spaces when possible (e.g., husband brings son to university office, kids visit colleagues in US).
- Uses location trackers (from tech‑savvy husband) on valuables and in child’s bag.
- Currently doesn’t expect child to communicate directly via device; relies on whoever is with him (teacher/caregiver) to call.
- Uses iPad with Parenting Mode and curated toddler shows; allows 30–60 minutes of YouTube/TV, especially when child is sick.
- Has weekend TV rules but is flexible; sometimes watches and sings along together as a family.
- Schedules outdoor/physical activities (basketball, soccer, swimming) to see what kids enjoy.
- Prioritises kids “learning to be a person” over early academic competition.

### Pain Points / Frustrations
- Social norms in Singapore make it harder to integrate kids into work compared to more accepting culture in US.
- Balancing high standards as a professional and as a mum is tiring (early prep, sick kids, long‑term career ambitions).
- Hard to find age‑appropriate online content; grandparents sometimes let kids watch “stupid” things online.
- Aware of many safety threats (e.g., internet, larger societal risks) but cannot control everything.
- Struggles between wanting to quickly protect kids vs. letting them learn from their own mistakes.

### Desired Features / Needs
- Tools that support bounded screen time so parents can have short “alone time” without guilt.
- Better curation and discovery of age‑appropriate, values‑aligned content for young children.
- Support for sensitive children adapting to school and communicating needs (e.g., during potty training).
- Solutions that respect children’s autonomy and help them “figure out how to be a person,” not just focus on academics.
- Technology that facilitates family bonding activities (e.g., singing together, shared viewing) rather than just passive solo screen time.

### Safety & Trust Requirements
- Trusts teachers/caregivers to handle emergency communication; does not expect a very young child to call directly.
- Wants tools that feel safe around data/location, similar to how they already use trackers responsibly.
- Believes strong parent‑child bond and open communication are key so kids will share if something is wrong.
- Accepts that the internet is inherently risky but prefers guidance and relationship over extreme restriction.

### Opportunities / Ideas
- Position devices less as mini smartphones and more as tools that support parental self‑care and alone time.
- Design features that encourage joint media engagement (singing, co‑watching, talking about content).
- Build recommendation/filtration that adapts to age and temperament (e.g., sensitive child) and parenting philosophy.
- Explore ways tech can legitimise/normalise kids’ presence in adult/work environments in a respectful way.
- Provide guidance or tooling for grandparents/caregivers to choose healthier, aligned content.

## Follow-Ups
- Explore more concretely what “good to have a tool” means (content controls, timers, communication, device form factor, etc.).
- Test reactions to different device types (watch, tag, phone‑like, screen‑free) for young kids.
- Probe expectations and boundaries for how grandparents/caregivers use content and devices with the children.
