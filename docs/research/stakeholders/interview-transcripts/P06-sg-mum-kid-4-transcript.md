Purpose: she is a working parent of a 4 yo child, relatively on the younger parent age group (28 year old), might have some new perspective. 

Transcript: 

Natasha explaining the digital landscape of parents and kids espefically in the age of AI. She is currently interviewing parents and cybersecurity specialists. 


Kai is 4 years old and will be in primary school in a few years. 


Emma is 28 years old 
Gov employee for 9 years ish 
Had a son after studies in 2021 
Son Kai is turning 5 in January
Been in school since he was 2 months (infant care) –. Exposed to the external world, social pressures, and digital space 

Nat: How is the experience of sending Kai to sending childcare and infant care? 

Emma: have been going to infant care for 2 months to 19 months
Started preschool from 6 months to a year 
Homeschooled in a foreign country → didn't know the people and kept out of the school for 7 months. Emma wasnt working and was able to take care of him full-time.

Came back to SG and put him back to preschool the same one as last time. 

The child may be passive & inquisitive. Receptive to whatever the teacher was doing. He was open to all forms of education or caregiving. So the transition from that period of homeschooling to preschool wasn't jarring. 

Routine: make food together, educate him on letters, developed a really strong bond with him. Moving on to preschool was a bit of an adjustment, from a focused caregiving environment to when he had to content ot the number of people around him, different forms of education, different types of teachers, and different forms of teaching. 


Nat: I understand the kind of background, especially in the times of homeschool, did u  feel the need to use any screens to help? 

Emma: in terms of education, it was pen and paper based. But never been the one to restrict never using screen time too much. Very open to exposing him to screens. The prevailing narrative is that screens will get him addicted. They wanted to kai to develop boundaries for himself. 

E.g 30 mins of screen time. Ask him if it's enough. Sometimes there would be negotiation. Teaching him the boundaries rather than imposing strict restrictions. 

As the world gets more digitalized, kids are going to be more exposed to digital devices. The earlier they learn the skill of regulation, the better. 

Emma has a brother 13 years younger than her. He was in pri school when she had Kai. Her dad was military and was very strict and disciplined. Brother would be rebellious and would hide in a corner with his iPad. 

Emma tried to actively try to manage that with Kai. might not work with every kid cause kids have different kinds of temperament. 


Nat: i was curious as screen time is so broad. What does kai do? Is it games or watch videos? 

Emaa: games were more recent like this year, Duolingo Kids. they have spelling, reading and arithmetic and trying to get him to learn Chinese but he is not interested. 

He usually play on Ipad. when younger, he would watch television and its more passive, taking in the content. 

So Emma tried to manage the content. Slipups were watching cocomelon although he did learn nursey rhymes but it was attention-grabbing, earlier stage of brain rot which she regretted showing him. 

She showed him others, Paw Patrol, teaching the children life skills and thought it was better. 

Nat: Cocomelon is shown on youtube. But other shows are shown on netlfix, disney+ etc. 

E: we actually have paid subscription, netflix, disney plus. Kai is at the stage where he can search, earlier on she would curate it for him. 


E: he watches yt on kids, disney+ is kids but knows how to toggle to an adult account. For netflix, just uses adult account. Toggeles using the remote. He sits in the bean bag at an appropriate distance away from the television. 

Generally she and her husband are at home. Right now, she is at home but she is not directly watching him or monitoring. 


E: initially i thought cocomelon was educational cause he can catch the tune and words. Later on, through tiktok, one of the education videos from education professor said how the children shows are designed to be addictive. Then she looked back on how Cocomelon songs were jarring - with a lot of words and graphics. 

E: Content creation is something we really bonded over. Kai is a performer, he is creative and enjoys being in front of the camera. Improves his skills. He learnt to speak while cooking together. He learnt to string together a storyline. Able to build upon a series. Became their thing and something to bond over. 

Kai would ask what kind of cooking or dance videos we can do together. 


N: does kai watch his own videos? 

E: he doesnt, but he watches over her shoulder and was like i know this song (opalite by TS). 

N: so his perception is that social media is a creative outlet instead of consumption. 

E: yes 

N: what age do you got him to start playing? Is it on ipad? 

E: How they got started. He started getting angsty on public transport. We would play alphabet games. He outgrew those games. Ipad became an easy answer but he would use it to draw cause he likes to do digital art. 
Earlier this year, they started on duolingo for kids. It was very helpful cause the words mirrors the education he was learning in school. So it was reinforcing that way. 

He has his own ipad and certain number of games which was acceptable. He is not allowed to download the games. If he finds something new, she will give him permission to download. 

She also doesn't want him to pay for the paid content and increase the bill. 


N: do you use parental control on your devices? 

E: parental control is like screentime. For the time spent, I have never used it. I don't feel the need to use it either. He is quite receptive when asked if he wants to try another activity. 

In terms of not allowing him to download new things, he doesn't have the password. 


It was one of those things we figured it out along the way. We didn't have a vision. We adapted along the way. We saw that being liberal with technologies, we continue to use them and regulate. It wasnt to learn regulation then we teach him screen time. 


N: What happens if kai goes over 5 mins? 

E: usually permissive, he wants to finish a chapter so after it. As long as he is able to switch off the device by himself and go about his day. I dont want to force him. If not he will be greedy with the screen time. 


N Asking about his routine of using ipad during food: 

E: it depends on the situation. For example i would bring an ipad if im going on a long mrt ride. If we are going out to a meal, bring out the ipad to play. If we are meeting friends and if we can have a food conversation or go to libraries, he knows that. He does find alternative things. He gets a bit impatient if the food doesnt arrive. The ipad app has a folder full of his drawings. 


N: alot of the screentime leads to dopamine. Is he generally been good with communication of feelings?

E: right now, he regulates his emotions very well. He communicates it well. She teaches him if he didnt ask, they wouldnt know. I do think there is a stage where he was younger, 2 years, he threw a tantrum but not digtial related. He would lie on the floor and scream. Affected the husband, asking Kai why you throwing a tantrum

After a bit of time, when hes more calmer, Emma would ask why he was upset and he learnt to articulate such thoughts. Nowadays, he doesnt throw tantrums at all. He can verbalise it. 

For Christmas dinner, her family usually talks over. Kai was trying to explain but family was talking over. He was frustrated but he kept it within himself. He was trying to understand his own emotions and that loop stop him from throwing tantrum. 

N: because you have practiced your way of self regulation, are you able to incorporate it to parenting? 

E: because im reflecting on the way i see the world, i dont see digital technologies as a harm to kai development. Its a part of life and need to learn how to navigate. I do enjoy journaling and thinking about my own thoughts. Thinking about the year we came back from SG, husband and I are communicating and able to bounce off ideas off of each other. It becomes easy. Journaling is something that I have been doing and kai has picked up. He has a notebook and sometimes he draws about the things he did that day. It evolved since 3.5 years. Every day when he takes his evening shower to bed, he would talk about his day. Talk about to mum, dad or even both. He would tell us how many things to talk about. He would talk about categories, like what he ate, playtime, and whatever items. Made him a bit more reflective and goes through his day. 

Someone took his book and he is able to unpack that, how the series played out and how everything worked out and how it translated to the parenting. 


E: I was 23 when I had Kai. I had a lot more energy than the other parents. Whenever there are special occasions, I have more energy. Even after a long day at work, I had a more emotional capacity to have that protected time. Wrap presents or bake cookies for the teachers. Harder for the older parents simply because its tiring and its a bit of age. 

Can relate to him. He was watching Little Einsteins and she watched it during her time so she is able to relate. Her colleague was pushing 30 and found it harder. 

There aren't many parents in that age group, so it gets harder to relate to them. They are probably brought up in a different age group. May not vibe directly. 


N: both of you are working parents. Work is stressful enough. How do you regulate that?

E: when i was homeschooling, i had more time to spend time with him. I could understand what he was feeling based on the vibe and mannerism. In terms of how we regulate and not bring work. Ryan and i can speak about the work without bringing in the emotions. We are very objective about the emotions and not bringing it to home. 

Ryan was doing something, he had his own protective time. She would spend more time with kai. Is he regulating his emotions? Is he crossing the line? 

E.g if he refuses to do anything than to watch tv. 


There are times where we get overwhelmed but we would have conversation with kai without the use of screen time. It also helps that usually we get overwheled, its one of us and not both of us. Kai would bother one and the other one would step in. good cop and bad cop. 

Happened this week where kai and Emma were frustrated with each other. Ryan stepped in. emma went to regulate like doomscroll before coming back to kai and ryan. 

E; sometimes we sit outside of the piano class and the kid can see you. Take the time to do grocery shopping. 30 - 45 mins lessons depending on the week. Kai would have the time alone. 


N: do u see the need to have a communicative-based device? 

E: Perhaps, when he is in primary school, there might be a need. MOE is imposing ban on the devices for sec school. Im open to giving him a device because he has demonstration. Might be different because of the peer pressure and the tolerance. Its definitely something i have to consider.

Smartphone and rudimentary phone, not opposed to the idea. Need to wait and see how it goes. Maybe get da omestic helper to send him to and fro school. 

Aish asked about the “asian parenting” technique and asked opinions about it and if its something E would incorporate in the future. 

E: i brought up in the culture of physical beating as a way of punishment. My dad did it in the way of professional way. She would have to go and get her own cane and how many strokes she deserves. There was this whole auction and negotiation. 

E.g I went to my friends house and lied about it. One stroke of the cane with hands out, with varying degrees of pain. Not as bad as other kids. 


Kai has never been beaten. I have told Ryan I would beat my son in a more principled manner. When he was younger, he would keep going to the powerpoints. I would beat him to make sure he would know not to. 

I wouldnt foresee a need because he tends to regulate his emotions well.
