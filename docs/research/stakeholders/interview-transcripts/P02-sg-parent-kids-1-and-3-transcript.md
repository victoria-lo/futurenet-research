## Child
- Child is a sensitive kid, took almost a year to get used to school 
- Would just observe at the side, won't participate in anything he is uncomfortable with
- Younger child more outgoing, plays with kids downstairs

# Screentime
- At first wanted no screen time
- But wanted to have healthy balance
- When child is sick, I need to incorporate him to my life, my work
- Let him use YouTube, 30min-1h
- Less fussy about him 
- Husband thinks everything is fine
- Instead of trying to make it perfect
- Have rules for child, during weekends watch TV, primarily toddler shows
- But even if they go over an hour, so what? Can watch and sing together as family

## On the need for parents
- Parents need to have their own life as well
- I need to teach my kids in a way they can protect themselves
- Her parenting style: consults pediatricians, strike a balance for self

## Reframing technology, Singing together
- WHen we catch flight to US, they also have self-control; they will stop their movies saying they have had enough and want to sing together
- Singing together as an activity, family time
- Make it fun time

## Challenges
- THink there is not much problem if I manage
- Husband coming back from work, he is tired
- She feels more energetic when I come back from work
- Adjust and see what might open up
- Sometimes too tired and doze off, realize kids can have their own independent time
- __When we need alone time, it's good to have a tool__
- There are many things to feel unsafe about, i.e. guns; internet is the way it is
- Spend more time building bonds so child will share everything, think that time is more important

## Grandparents
- They watch stupid things on the internet

## Age appropriate
- Finding age appropriate material is difficult
- Try to pick and choose what is appropriate to them
- Feel in Singapore it's too stressful, too much competition

## Child activities
- Schedule time to take them downstairs for basketball or soccer, to see what they like more
- Also have pools, girls like to swim
- Haven't thought about extracurricular activities, prioritizing sports
- Reflecting on own parents who told her to study alot
- After quitting corporate job and moving to sg, have less cashflow
- Kids have to figure out how to be a person first, and how to live their life
- Won't force kids to study - want them to figure out what they want and what's best for their personality
- Getting hard for me to not rush to protect them, but let them learn from their own mistakes

## On parenting philosophy
- Strongly resonated with American child parenting strategy
- Our generation have resources at our fingertips, we have choice
- The average Singaporean is smart 
- __Nothing right or wrong, being more graceful with self__
